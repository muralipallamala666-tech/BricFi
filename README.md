# BrickFi

**Build wealth, brick by brick.**

BrickFi is a decentralized real estate platform that tokenizes premium properties into on-chain assets. Invest in fractional ownership, earn rental yields, and manage your portfolio — all powered by blockchain.

## Features

- **Tokenized Properties** — Browse and invest in fractional real estate tokens
- **Wallet Integration** — Connect with MetaMask, WalletConnect, and more via RainbowKit

- **Admin Panel** — Manage properties and smart contract deployments
- **Multi-chain Support** — Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and Sepolia testnet

## Design

BrickFi uses a warm, modern design system:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Brick (accent) | `#E0634A` | Primary brand, CTAs, highlights |
| Fi (secondary) | `#2DB896` | Finance accents, yields, APY |
| Void | `#0C0E12` → `#1E232B` | Backgrounds and surfaces |
| Cream | `#F5F0EB` | Typography |

Typography: **Outfit** (headings) + **Plus Jakarta Sans** (body)
